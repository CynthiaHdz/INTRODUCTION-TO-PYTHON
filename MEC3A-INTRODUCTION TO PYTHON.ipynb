    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a programming language designed by computer scientist [Guido Van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io//), developed in the late 80's and early 90's. Guido had carried out this language as a hobby, following the ABC language that he had used at the time. **Python's** name comes from his liking for *Monty Pythons*, which was a British comedy series that entertained the computer scientist at the time, and he was also looking for a mysterious and attention-grabbing name."

    "**Python** is known for being a multiparadigm language since it supports object-oriented programming, imperative programming and, to a lesser extent, functional programming. This language was created in a way that was easy to use, intuitive and friendly, thus being one of the most used languages, since as hardware technology advanced, its popularity increased. **Python** has many functionalities because it allows you to automate tasks, explore data, and it is very important in machine learning entertainment. It is not only limited to a single application area, as **Python** is used in web development, data science, machine learning, data analysis and even for simple game programming."

    "\n",
    ">Over the years, several versions of **Python** have been made public where respective improvements have been seen. In 1991, what would be the first test version of **Python**, version **0.9.0**, was released, revealing the module system from *Modula-3*, this being the largest unit for **Python** programming.\n",
    "A few years later, in 1994, version 1.0 arrived, which included very useful programming tools such as *Lambda, Reduce, Filter and Map*. The following year **Python 1.2** would be published, of which different versions of it were released.\n",
    "In 2000 **Python** made the decision to make its change to *BeOpen* and with this in progress, version **1.6** was published, which obtained a longer license compared to previous versions.\n",
    "Python at that time was not compatible with the *GPL* and because the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/?set_language=es) argued the incompatibility of **Python** with *GNU GPL*, an agreement was carried out where the **Python** license would change to a *Free Software license*, thus giving us the new version **1.6.1**.\n",
    "For version **2.0**, the implementation of list creation is carried out, a fundamental characteristic of the *Haskell* language, as well as a garbage collection system. During 2001 the creation of [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) takes place and **Python 2.6** comes to light with the code, documentation and language specifications, all absolutely.\n",
    "And finally, version **3.0** is published in 2008, being in the same way as its previous versions but also designed to rectify flaws in the language and including new forms of programming."
